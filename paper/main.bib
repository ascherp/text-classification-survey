abstract="Weakly supervised text classification leverages only label class names as signals to train classifiers. Most existing methods rely on various techniques such as keyword-driven or clustering methods to generate pseudo-labels for iterative training. However, acquiring diversified samples during the iterative process and mitigating error accumulation remain significant challenges. In this paper, we propose PLIClass, a pseudo-labeling-driven iterative framework for weakly supervised text classification. The framework consists of two modules: (1) a diversified pseudo-label acquisition module that integrates clustering and sampling techniques to procure a dataset that is both accurate and varied, and (2) a noise-resistant inference module that employs these pseudo-labels to facilitate joint model inference, thereby mitigating the error accumulation typically associated with the training process. PLIClass demonstrates superior performance compared to strong baselines on five benchmark datasets, and approaching the performance of methods that rely on limited labeled samples.",

Text classification has been widely used in many practical scenarios such as sentiment analysis and topic classification, and is an important task in the field of natural language processing. In recent years, research on pre-training model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has made remarkable progress. However, at present, most studies are based on open source databases. In this study, a text classification model combining BERT model and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to complete the text emotion classification task through the self-built dialect text database. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of this model in Chinese text classification tasks by comparing experiments and performance evaluation.

    abstract = "In this work, we explore {``}prompt tuning,{''} a simple yet effective mechanism for learning {``}soft prompts{''} to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3{'}s few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method {``}closes the gap{''} and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed {``}prefix tuning{''} of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient {``}prompt ensembling.{''} We release code and model checkpoints to reproduce our experiments.",

    abstract = "Prompt tuning, which only tunes continuous prompts with a frozen language model, substantially reduces per-task storage and memory usage at training. However, in the context of NLU, prior work reveals that prompt tuning does not perform well for normal-sized pretrained models. We also find that existing methods of prompt tuning cannot handle hard sequence labeling tasks, indicating a lack of universality. We present a novel empirical finding that properly optimized prompt tuning can be universally effective across a wide range of model scales and NLU tasks. It matches the performance of finetuning while having only 0.1{\%}-3{\%} tuned parameters. Our method P-Tuning v2 is an implementation of Deep Prompt Tuning (CITATION) optimized and adapted for NLU. Given the universality and simplicity of P-Tuning v2, we believe it can serve as an alternative to finetuning and a strong baseline for future research.",

  abstract     = {Text classification is a central task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims at categorizing text documents into predefined classes or categories. It requires appropriate features to describe the contents and meaning of text documents, and map them with their target categories. Existing text feature representations rely on a weighted representation of the document terms. Hence, choosing a suitable method for term weighting is of major importance and can help increase the effectiveness of the classification task. In this study, we provide a novel text classification framework for Category-based Feature Engineering titled CFE. It consists of a supervised weighting scheme defined based on a variant of the TF-ICF (Term Frequency-Inverse Category Frequency) model, embedded into three new lean classification approaches: (i) IterativeAdditive (flat), (ii) GradientDescentANN (1-layered), and (iii) FeedForwardANN (2-layered). The IterativeAdditive approach augments each document representation with a set of synthetic features inferred from TF-ICF category representations. It builds a term-category TF-ICF matrix using an iterative and additive algorithm that produces category vector representations and updates until reaching convergence. GradientDescentANN replaces the iterative additive process mentioned previously by computing the term-category matrix using a gradient descent ANN model. Training the ANN using the gradient descent algorithm allows updating the term-category matrix until reaching convergence. FeedForwardANN uses a feed-forward ANN model to transform document representations into the category vector space. The transformed document vectors are then compared with the target category vectors, and are associated with the most similar categories. We have implemented CFE including its three classification approaches, and we have conducted a large battery of tests to evaluate their performance. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that our lean approaches mostly improve text classification accuracy while requiring significantly less computation time compared with their deep model alternatives.}

  abstract     = {Hierarchical multi-label text classification (HMTC) aims to tag each document with a set of classes from a taxonomic class hierarchy. Most existing HMTC methods train classifiers using massive human-labeled documents, which are often too costly to obtain in real-world applications. In this paper, we explore to conduct HMTC based on only class surface names as supervision signals. We observe that to perform HMTC, human experts typically first pinpoint a few most essential classes for the document as its {``}core classes{''}, and then check core classes{'} ancestor classes to ensure the coverage. To mimic human experts, we propose a novel HMTC framework, named TaxoClass. Specifically, TaxoClass (1) calculates document-class similarities using a textual entailment model, (2) identifies a document{'}s core classes and utilizes confident core classes to train a taxonomy-enhanced classifier, and (3) generalizes the classifier via multi-label self-training. Our experiments on two challenging datasets show TaxoClass can achieve around 0.71 Example-F1 using only class names, outperforming the best previous method by 25{\%}.}

  abstract     = {In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we obtain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to `justify' ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the information present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent factors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews.},

Drawing on interviews with Reuters personnel and access to Reuters documentation, we describe the coding policy and quality control procedures used in producing the RCV1 data, the intended semantics of the hierarchical category taxonomies, and the corrections necessary to remove errorful data. We refer to the original data as RCV1-v1, and the corrected data as RCV1-v2. We benchmark several widely used supervised learning methods on RCV1-v2, illustrating the collection's properties, suggesting new directions for research, and providing baseline results for future studies.

abstract = {Text classification plays a critical role in managing large volumes of electronically produced texts. As the number of such texts increases, manual analysis becomes impractical, necessitating an intelligent approach for processing information. Deep learning models have witnessed widespread application in text classification, including the use of recurrent neural networks like Many to One Long Short-Term Memory (MTO LSTM). Nonetheless, this model is limited by its reliance on only the last token for text labelling. To overcome this limitation, this study introduces a novel hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Many To Many Long Short-Term Memory (MTM LSTM), and Decision Templates (DT) for text classification. In this new model, the text is first embedded using the BERT model and then trained using MTM LSTM to approximate the target at each token. Finally, the approximations are fused using DT. The proposed model is evaluated using the well-known IMDB movie review dataset for binary classification and Drug Review Dataset for multiclass classification. The results demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score compared to previous models. The hybrid model presented in this study holds significant potential for a wide range of text classification tasks and stands as a valuable contribution to the field.}

  abstract     = {Hierarchical text classification aims to leverage label hierarchy in multi-label text classification. Existing methods encode label hierarchy in a global view, where label hierarchy is treated as the static hierarchical structure containing all labels. Since global hierarchy is static and irrelevant to text samples, it makes these methods hard to exploit hierarchical information. Contrary to global hierarchy, local hierarchy as a structured labels hierarchy corresponding to each text sample. It is dynamic and relevant to text samples, which is ignored in previous methods. To exploit global and local hierarchies, we propose Hierarchy-guided BERT with Global and Local hierarchies (HBGL), which utilizes the large-scale parameters and prior language knowledge of BERT to model both global and local hierarchies. Moreover, HBGL avoids the intentional fusion of semantic and hierarchical modules by directly modeling semantic and hierarchical information with BERT. Compared with the state-of-the-art method HGCLR, our method achieves significant improvement on three benchmark datasets.}

  abstract     = {Text classiﬁcation is the most fundamental and foundational problem in many natural language processing applications. Recently, the graph-based model (e.g., GNN-based model and GCN-based model) has been applied to this task and achieved excellent performance because of their superior capacity of modeling context from the global perspective. However, a multitude of existing graph-based models constructs a corpus-level graph structure which causes a high memory consumption and overlooks the local contextual information. To address these issues, we present a novel GNNbased model which contains a new model for building a text graph for text classiﬁcation. The proposed model is called two sliding windows text GNN-based model (TSW-GNN). To be more speciﬁc, a unique text-level graph is constructed for each text, which contains a dynamic global window and a local sliding window. The local window slides inside the text to construct local word connections. Additionally, the dynamic global window slides between texts to determine word edge weights, which conquers the limitation of a single local sliding window and provides more abundant global information. We perform extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, and the experimental results manifest the amelioration of TSW-GNN over the most advanced models in terms of the classiﬁcation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The experimental study of language change may provide novel insights into the nature of language, in particular on the role of cognitive biases and social processes in shaping grammatical and semantic structures. Here, we introduce multigenerational signaling games (MGSGs) as a new experimental paradigm for investigating how simple compositional languages emerge and change during transmission across generations in a diffusion chain, where each transmission step requires coordination between sender and receiver in a signaling game. We obtained three main results. First, we replicate and extend earlier ﬁndings by Moreno and Baggio suggesting that, in signaling games with ﬁxed roles, mappings of signals to meanings tend to be transmitted from senders to receivers. We show that this holds for signaling games played in diffusion chains too, in which the receiver in one game becomes the sender in the next game. Second, we provide an experimental proof of concept that MGSGs are a viable laboratory model of cultural language change. Players consistently agreed upon a common signaling system after repeated signaling rounds, and the resulting code was effectively transmitted and gradually modiﬁed over generations. Third, we establish a baseline of results for further research using MGSGs. We found that the order of elements initially imposed on signals is largely maintained by successive generations. Moreover, the degree of coordination among players and the ﬁdelity of inter-generational transmission exhibit a cumulative increase across generations. Finally, replicating a seminal result by Esper, we observed that morphological marking of semantic categories such as agent, action, and patient emerged gradually in the course of transmission.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have been blossoming in recent years, but the unique data processing and evaluation setups used by each work obstruct a full understanding of their advancements. In this work, we present a systematical reproduction of 12 recent HGNNs by using their official codes, datasets, settings, and hyperparameters, revealing surprising findings about the progress of HGNNs. We find that the simple homogeneous GNNs, e.g., GCN and GAT, are largely underestimated due to improper settings. GAT with proper inputs can generally match or outperform all existing HGNNs across various scenarios. To facilitate robust and reproducible HGNN research, we construct the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB)1, consisting of 11 diverse datasets with three tasks. HGB standardizes the process of heterogeneous graph data splits, feature processing, and performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce a simple but very strong baseline Simple-HGN—which significantly outperforms all previous models on HGB—to accelerate the advancement of HGNNs in the future.}

  abstract     = {Text classification is an important assignment for various text-related downstream assignments, such as fake news detection, sentiment analysis, and question answering. In recent years, the graph-based method achieves excellent results in text classification tasks. Instead of regarding a text as a sequence structure, this method regards it as a co-occurrence set of words. The task of text classification is then accomplished by aggregating the data from nearby nodes using the graph neural network. However, existing corpus-level graph models are difficult to incorporate the local semantic information and classify new coming texts. To address these issues, we propose a Global\textendash Local Text Classification (GLTC) model, based on the KL constraints to realize inductive learning for text classification. Firstly, a global structural feature extractor and a local semantic feature extractor are designed to capture the structural and semantic information of text comprehensively. Then, the KL divergence is introduced as a regularization term in the loss calculation process, which ensures that the global structural feature extractor can constrain the learning of the local semantic feature extractor to achieve inductive learning. The comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets present that GLTC outperforms baseline methods in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspecific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

Nowadays deep learning-based methods have shown significant success in XMC. However, the existing methods (e.g., AttentionXML and X-Transformer etc) still suffer from 1) combining several models to train and predict for one dataset, and 2) sampling negative labels statically during the process of training label ranking model, which will harm the performance and accuracy of model. To address the above problems, we propose LightXML, which adopts end-to-end training and dynamical negative labels sampling. In LightXML, we use GAN like networks to recall and rank labels. The label recalling part will generate negative and positive labels, and the label ranking part will distinguish positive labels from these labels. Based on these networks, negative labels are sampled dynamically during label ranking part training. With feeding both label recalling and ranking parts with the same text representation, LightXML can reach high performance. Extensive experiments show that LightXML outperforms state-of-the-art methods in five extreme multi-label datasets with much smaller model size and lower computational complexity. In particular, on the Amazon dataset with  670K labels, LightXML can reduce the model size up to 72\% compared to AttentionXML. Our code is available at http://github.com/kongds/LightXML.},

In this paper, we propose a convolutional architecture InceptionXML which is light-weight, yet powerful, and robust to the inherent lack of word-order in short-text queries encountered in search and recommendation. We demonstrate the efficacy of applying convolutions by recasting the operation along the embedding dimension instead of the word dimension as applied in conventional CNNs for text classification. Towards scaling our model to datasets with millions of labels, we also propose SyncXML pipeline which improves upon the shortcomings of the recently proposed dynamic hard-negative mining technique for label shortlisting by synchronizing the label-shortlister and extreme classifier. SyncXML not only reduces the inference time to half but is also an order of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art Astec in terms of model size. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison, we show that not only can InceptionXML outperform existing approaches on benchmark datasets but also the transformer baselines requiring only 2\% FLOPs. The code for InceptionXML is available at https://github.com/xmc-aalto.},

  abstract = {Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) is an important problem in the  era of \{{\textbackslash}it big data\}, for tagging a given text with the most relevant multiple  labels from an extremely large-scale label set. XMTC can be found in many  applications, such as item categorization, web page tagging, and news  annotation. Traditionally most methods used bag-of-words (BOW) as inputs, ignoring word  context as well as deep semantic information. Recent attempts to overcome the  problems of BOW by deep learning still suffer from 1) failing to capture the  important subtext for each label and 2) lack of scalability against the huge  number of labels. We propose a new label tree-based deep learning model for XMTC, called  AttentionXML, with two unique features: 1) a multi-label attention mechanism  with raw text as input, which allows to capture the most relevant part of text  to each label; and 2) a shallow and wide probabilistic label tree (PLT), which  allows to handle millions of labels, especially for "tail labels". We empirically compared the performance of AttentionXML with those of eight  state-of-the-art methods over six benchmark datasets, including Amazon-3M with  around 3 million labels. AttentionXML outperformed all competing methods  under all experimental settings. Experimental results also show that AttentionXML achieved the best performance  against tail labels among label tree-based methods.

Despite leveraging pre-trained transformer models for text representation, the fine-tuning procedure of transformer models on large label space still has lengthy computational time even with powerful GPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel recursive approach, XR-Transformer to accelerate the procedure through recursively fine-tuning transformer models on a series of multi-resolution objectives related to the original XMC objective function. Empirical results show that XR-Transformer takes significantly less training time compared to other transformer-based XMC models while yielding better state-of-the-art results. In particular, on the public Amazon-3M dataset with 3 million labels, XR-Transformer is not only 20x faster than X-Transformer but also improves the Precision@1 from 51\% to 54\%.},

  abstract = {Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.}

    abstract = "Recent foundational language models have shown state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. An advantage of these models over more standard approaches based on fine-tuning is the ability to understand instructions written in natural language (prompts), which helps them generalise better to different tasks and domains without the need for specific training data. This makes them suitable for addressing text classification problems for domains with limited amounts of annotated instances. However, existing research is limited in scale and lacks understanding of how text generation models combined with prompting techniques compare to more established methods for text classification such as fine-tuning masked language models. In this paper, we address this research gap by performing a large-scale evaluation study for 16 text classification datasets covering binary, multiclass, and multilabel problems. In particular, we compare zero- and few-shot approaches of large language models to fine-tuning smaller language models. We also analyse the results by prompt, classification type, domain, and number of labels. In general, the results show how fine-tuning smaller and more efficient language models can still outperform few-shot approaches of larger language models, which have room for improvement when it comes to text classification.",

  abstract = 	 {We describe PromptBoosting, a query-efficient procedure for building a text classifier from a neural language model (LM) without access to the LM’s parameters, gradients, or hidden representations. This form of "black-box" classifier training has become increasingly important as the cost of training and inference in large-scale LMs has grown. But existing black-box LM classifier learning approaches are themselves computationally inefficient, typically specializing LMs to the target task by searching in a large space of (discrete or continuous) prompts using zeroth-order optimization methods. Instead of directly optimizing in prompt space, PromptBoosting obtains a small pool of prompts via a gradient-free approach and then constructs a large pool of weak learners by pairing these prompts with different elements of the LM’s output distribution. These weak learners are then ensembled using the AdaBoost algorithm. The entire learning process requires only a small number of forward passes and no backward pass. Experiments show that PromptBoosting achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple black-box few-shot classification tasks, and matches or outperforms full fine-tuning in both few-shot and standard learning paradigms, while training 10x faster than existing black-box methods.}

ABSTRACT = {While collections of documents are often annotated with hierarchically structured concepts, the benefits of these structures are rarely taken into account by classification techniques. Within this context, hierarchical text classification methods are devised to take advantage of the labels’ organization to boost classification performance. In this work, we aim to deliver an updated overview of the current research in this domain. We begin by defining the task and framing it within the broader text classification area, examining important shared concepts such as text representation. Then, we dive into details regarding the specific task, providing a high-level description of its traditional approaches. We then summarize recently proposed methods, highlighting their main contributions. We also provide statistics for the most commonly used datasets and describe the benefits of using evaluation metrics tailored to hierarchical settings. Finally, a selection of recent proposals is benchmarked against non-hierarchical baselines on five public domain-specific datasets. These datasets, along with our code, are made available for future research.},
